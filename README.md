# N-Back Task (GUI)

Idea:  
A GUI program that implements the N-Back task, a standard test for working memory and continuous attention. Participants see a sequence of stimuli (numbers or letters) and must respond when the current stimulus matches the one N steps back.

Objective:  
- Demonstrate understanding of working memory and continuous attention.  
- Collect response accuracy and reaction time.  
- Introduce dynamic difficulty with different N values.

How it works:  
The program displays stimuli one by one. The participant presses a key if the current stimulus matches the one N steps back. The program records reaction times, accuracy, and overall performance.

Usage:  
Run the script in Python. Follow the on-screen instructions. Choose the difficulty level (N) and complete the task.
